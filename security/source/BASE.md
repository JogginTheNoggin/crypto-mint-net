## What is in scope

Everything outside `gui/`: the consensus packages, `wire` and `p2p`
(anything a peer sends), `registry`, the local RPC (`pkg/rpc`, including
the new watch stream and follow/reload endpoints), node files and the
store, the wallet, `pkg/cli` and `pkg/daemon`, and the release scripts.
